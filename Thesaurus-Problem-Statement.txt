A multi-lingual thesaurus actor provides synonyms of English words, in English and Hindi
It employs two linguist actors to help it
One understands English and the other, Hindi
There may be zero, one or more synonyms available for each English word supplied
An user specifies which language is she interested in (may be both), and supplies an English word
The linguist actors learn too 
collects synonyms they havenâ€™t known so far
